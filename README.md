# Feedvestigate
Feedvestigate scrolls your Facebook feeds and visualizes them on D3 charts

>__Update July 2016__

>3 years since this project, Facebook now launches 45 sec birthday recap video which collates all your birthday wishes.

## Rationale
We are often bombarded with tons of birthday wishes on our Facebook wall.
Friends, best friends, childhood friends, aquintances, why-is-this-person-on-my-list friends, 
everyone would want to wish you on your birthday.

Wouldn't it be nice to see all those wishes together?
Wouldn't it be cool to see which is the most unique wish you have got?
or the most common wishes?

This project attempts to visualize your Faceboook feeds and visualizes them into a tree graph.
